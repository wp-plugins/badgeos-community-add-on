Adds BadgeOS features to BuddyPress and bbPress. Earn badges based on community activity, and display them on user profiles and activity feeds.

== Description ==

The "BadgeOS Community Add-on" integrates BadgeOS features into BuddyPress and bbPress. Site members complete achievements and earn badges based on a range of community activity and triggers. This add-on to BadgeOS also includes the ability to display badges and achievements on user profiles and activity feeds. 

**Note:** You will need to install the free [BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS")&trade; (version 1.0.2 or higher) to use the BadgeOS Community Add-on. You will also need the [BuddyPress plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress/ "BadgeOS") v1.7 or higher installed.

[Get the BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS").

[BadgeOS](http://badgeos.org "BadgeOS")&trade; turns your WordPress site into an achievement and badging system. And with BuddyPress enabled on your site, achievements are not only awarded by demonstrating skills and knowledge, but also by participating in community activities. Define the achievements, organize the badge requirements any way you like, and choose from and combine a range of assessment and community activity options to determine whether each task or requirement has been achieved.

Earned badges are Mozilla OBI compatible and sharable via [Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly.com"), the free web service for recognizing and displaying lifelong achievement.

**New ways to define achievements and give badges for community activity**

In addition to all of the out-of-the-box features in BadgeOS core, this add-on allows you to award badges based on these additional triggers:

*   **Profile Updates:**

   *   update your profile information
   *   upload an avatar to your profile

* **Social Actions:**

   *   post an activity update
   *   reply to an activity update
   *   adds a friend
   *   send a message

*   **Group Actions:**

   *   join any group
   *   join a specific group
   *   post a group activity update
   *   become a group moderator

*   **Discussion Forum Actions:**

   *   post a forum topic
   *   reply to a forum topic

**Social Display of Badges and Achievements:**

*   Display earned badges and achievements of any kind on user profiles
*   Add activity updates to user Activity feed when badges and achievements are earned
*   Each user may share his or her earned badges on social networks via Credly

**User and BadgeOS Settings:**

*   User can enable/disable Credly sharing settings via community profile
*   BadgeOS admin can select which custom BadgeOS achievement types should
be displayed on user profiles
*   BadgeOS admin can select which custom BadgeOS achievement types should
be displayed in Activity feeds

**Combine Community Steps with BadgeOS Steps in Defining Achievements**

*   Simple interface for defining the "Required Steps" for any badge or achievement seamlessly integrates community actions
*   Easily define achievements that rely on both BadgeOS required steps and community actions
*   Easily link together one or more triggers, steps or actions into the conditions needed to earn any badge or mark an achievement.

**Community Badges are Sharable with Credly Integration**

*   As with the BadgeOS core plugin, community badges are Mozilla Open Badge (OBI) compatible through integration of the "Open Credit" API by [Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly.com"), the free web service for issuing, earning and sharing badges.
*   Badges you create in BadgeOS automatically appear and update on Credly
*   Use Credly iOS app to issue community badges you created on your WordPress/BuddyPress/BadgeOS site. 
*   As badges are earned on WordPress/BuddyPress, they can be automatically sent to Credly for easy sharing on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Mozilla Backpack, the earner's own web site, blog, or Credly profile.
